# WP-MC-Query

This Wordpress plugin is designed to query information about Minecraft servers using the GameSpy4 protocol. It relies on [xPaw's library](https://github.com/xPaw/PHP-Minecraft-Query) to do its bidding. If you have any issues with the actual query logic, or need help setting it up, please direct your attention there.
